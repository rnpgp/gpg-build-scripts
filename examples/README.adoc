This directory contains usage examples for `gpg-build-scripts`.  This README
document describes these examples.

Every example is tested in Travis CI.  They all together comprise a test suite
for `gpg-build-scripts`.  Every example is arranged as follows: it begins
with a variable definitions block, which is followed with actual installation
commands, and ends with a sequence of assertions which confirm installation
correctness.  Every example includes comments.

`all_latest.sh`::
	Shows how to install the latest versions of GnuPG components with default
	options.  Requires to be executed as sudoer.  This is the example you should
	checkout first, probably.
`all_2.2.sh`::
	Same as above, but installs GnuPG 2.2.  Component versions are frozen,
	and are not necessarily the latest ones.
`all_2.1.sh`::
	Same as above, but installs GnuPG 2.1.  Component versions are frozen.
`all_head.sh`::
	Shows how to install all GnuPG components from Git, as of current master.
`build_dir.sh`::
	Shows how to perform the build in a custom directory.  Potentially useful
	when one wants to cache the source code, or inspect the failed build.
`components_individually.sh`::
	Shows how to install individual GnuPG components, one by one.  Allows for
	fine-grained configuration.
`configure_options.sh`::
	Shows how to pass various options to the configure script.
`gpgme`::
	Shows how to install GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) API.
`install_prefix.sh`::
	Shows how to install GnuPG into an arbitrary location.
`no_sudo.sh`::
	Shows how to install GnuPG without root privileges.
`verify`::
	Shows how to verify authenticity of GnuPG releases.
