# This example shows how to use the --build-dir option.
#
# By default, the install script creates a temporary directory in which
# the whole build happens.  However, sometimes you may want to use a specific
# directory instead.  Typical reasons are caching the source code, or keeping
# the build which has failed for inspection.

# The --sudo option is typically needed when installing to standard locations.
# Note that `sudo ./install_gpg_all …` is not the same—it would compile as
# root (not recommended).
#
# The --ldconfig option is typically needed on GNU+Linux systems.  It causes
# `ldconfig` to be run right after installing each component in order to
# reconfigure dynamic linker run-time bindings, in other words to make the
# installed shared libraries working correctly.  This option should not be
# enabled on systems which do not feature `ldconfig`.
