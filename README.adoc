A set of build scripts for GNU Privacy Guard.

== Prerequisites

Build should succeed on any Linux distribution, and similar systems.  Popular
GNU build tools are required.  For Ubuntu, following packages should be enough:
`libgnutls28-dev`, `bzip2`, `make`, `gettext`, `texinfo`, `gnutls-bin`,
`build-essential`, `g++`.  (List taken from this comment:
https://gist.github.com/mattrude/3883a3801613b048d45b#gistcomment-2378027).

When building from Git, additional software is needed, in particular Git,
Automake, and a recent version of Gettext.  Note that Gettext available in
Ubuntu Trusty is too old for this purpose--this fact must be taken into account
when building from Git in Travis CI environment.

== Scripts

TIP: Most likely you'll want to run `install_gpg_all.sh`, however
`install_gpg_component.sh` gives greater flexibility.  Oh, and check out
the `examples` subdirectory.

=== `install_gpg_component.sh`

Builds and installs a specific component of GnuPG.  The source code is obtained
either from released tarballs, or from Git repository.

When building stable releases from tarballs, two options are mandatory:

* `--component-name`, which specifies a component name
* `--component-version`, which specifies component version (can be `latest`)

.Example: building the most recent release of Pinentry.
[source,bash]
----
./install_gpg_component.sh \
  --component-name pinentry \
  --component-version latest
----

.Example: building Pinentry version 1.1.0.
[source,bash]
----
./install_gpg_component.sh \
  --component-name pinentry \
  --component-version 1.1.0
----

When building from Git repository, two options are mandatory:

* `--component-name`, which specifies a component name
* `--component-git-ref`, which specifies a Git branch or tag (commonly `master`)

.Example: building Pinentry from Git as of current master.
[source,bash]
----
./install_gpg_component.sh \
  --component-name pinentry \
  --component-git-ref master
----

For a complete list available options, run the script with `--help` option:

.Example: printing script help.
[source,bash]
----
./install_gpg_component.sh --help
----

=== `install_gpg_all.sh`

Builds and installs all components of GnuPG (but not GPGME, which must be
installed separately via `install_gpg_component.sh` if desired).

The `--suite-version` parameter describes the combination of component versions.
Supported values are: `2.1`, `2.2`, `latest`, and `master`, which are defined as
follows:

* `2.1` means GnuPG 2.1, and other component as in this Gist:
  https://gist.github.com/mattrude/3883a3801613b048d45b
* `2.2` means GnuPG 2.1, and other component as in this Gist:
  https://gist.github.com/vt0r/a2f8c0bcb1400131ff51
* `latest` means the latest version of GnuPG and all its components.  They are
  obtained from https://versions.gnupg.org/swdb.lst, which is maintained by
  GnuPG developers, and which is used by GnuPG's stock software updater.
* `master` means whatever is currently on `master` branch in Git.

TIP: Prefer `latest` over `2.2`.

Any other arguments are passed to `install_gpg_component.sh`, which is invoked
from `install_gpg_all.sh` for every component once.  For example, following
snippet will install the freshest GnuPG without documentation
(`--configure-opts "--disable-doc"` will be passed to component install
scripts):

[source,bash]
----
./install_gpg_all.sh \
  --suite-version latest \
  --configure-opts "--disable-doc"
----

== Tips & tricks

=== Passing options to `./configure` script

The `--configure-opts` allows to pass options to `./configure` scripts.  For
example:

[source,bash]
----
./install_gpg_component.sh \
  --component-name pinentry \
  --component-version latest \
  --configure-opts "--enable-pinentry-qt --enable-pinentry-curses"
----

Setting a custom installation prefix is not that straightforward.
The `./configure` script assumes that all the dependencies are installed in
`/usr/lib`, hence you need to override them as in example:

[source,bash]
----
./install_gpg_all.sh \
  --suite-version latest \
  --configure-opts "\
    --prefix=/opt/gpg \
    --with-libgpg-error-prefix=/opt/gpg \
    --with-libassuan-prefix=/opt/gpg \
    --with-libgpg-error-prefix=/opt/gpg \
    --with-libgcrypt-prefix=/opt/gpg \
    --with-libassuan-prefix=/opt/gpg \
    --with-ksba-prefix=/opt/gpg \
    --with-npth-prefix=/opt/gpg"
----

You may see a bunch of warnings as some of these options are relevant only to
few components, but that won't break your build.

=== Using with Travis CI

This scripts have been designed to work in Travis CI.  Use following listing
as example of `.travis.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
dist: trusty
sudo: required
language: ruby

env:
  global:
    - GPG_BUILD_DIR="$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/build_gpg"
    - >
      GPG_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--disable-doc --enable-pinentry-curses
      --disable-pinentry-emacs --disable-pinentry-gtk2 --disable-pinentry-gnome3
      --disable-pinentry-qt --disable-pinentry-qt4 --disable-pinentry-qt5
      --disable-pinentry-tqt --disable-pinentry-fltk"

  matrix:
    - GPG_VERSION="latest"
    - GPG_VERSION="2.1"

before_install:
  - >
    ./install_gpg_all.sh
    --suite-version "$GPG_VERSION"
    --build-dir "$GPG_BUILD_DIR"
    --configure-opts "$GPG_CONFIGURE_OPTS"
    --folding-style travis
  - gem install bundler -v 1.16.1
----

Please note the `--folding-style travis` option.  It makes the job logs more
readable, as it divides the output of build steps into foldable sections.
